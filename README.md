# Hi, I am a freshman at HCMUS^^

This repository contains my solutions to assignments and exercises from the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course. 
All problems are either assigned in class or practiced independently to reinforce key concepts.

## 📚 Contents

- ✅ Implementations of common data structures:
  - Linked List (Single, Double)
  - Stack & Queue
  - Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree
  - Heap, Hash Table
- ✅ Algorithms:
  - Sorting & Searching
  - Recursion & Backtracking
  - Divide & Conquer
  - Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
- ✅ Each file includes:
  - The problem description (in comments)
  - My solution with clear structure
  - Some files include input/output examples

## 🧠 Purpose

- Practice DSA systematically.
- Build a strong foundation for competitive programming and software engineering.
- Share my learning journey with others (especially fellow freshmen 👩‍💻👨‍💻).

## 🛠 Technologies

- Language: C++
- IDE: Visual Studio Code.
- No external libraries used unless stated otherwise.

## 💡 Note

This repository is intended for educational and reference purposes.  
Feel free to use the code for learning, but **avoid plagiarism** in your own assignments!
